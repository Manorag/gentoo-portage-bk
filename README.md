# portage-bk

This repository is intended as a backup and change tracking system for the `/etc/portage` directory on my Gentoo Linux system.

## Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to maintain a versioned backup of all Portage configuration files. This allows me to:

- Monitor and review configuration changes over time
- Restore working configurations if something breaks
- Recover critical system settings in case of a system crash or corruption

## Notes

This repository is optimized specifically for my machine and setup. It is not intended to be portable or used on other systems.

No sensitive data (such as private keys, passwords, or tokens) is stored or tracked in this repository.

## Disclaimer

This repository is intended for **personal use** as a backup and configuration history tool.
